Some simple scripts using the givenergy api. Not terribly idiomatic since python isn't really my first choice of language, but it seems to be popular, and has a rich standard library (and it's growing on me).

Needs the addon `requests` package - on a debian system, package python3-requests or get it from pip. Note that on my raspberry pi, the debian is old, and the requests package is a bit outdated. I ought to embrace `venv` and install a non-debian version for use with this script. For now, I use a deprecated way to do the retries.

What I should really do is make an abstraction so that you can choose to either use the api or a direct connection via givenergy-modbus.

*Note* that these are very much as-is, and are tailored for my system. I hope they are of use to others, but at the very least, you'll need to check that the numbers for the settings match your system - I don't know if they vary between different revisions of the hardware. Invoking `givenergy.py` with no parameters should list all the settings available on your system.

## My setup

### Background

A background on how I use my system might explain some of the rational...

I have 6.4kWp SSW solar feeding 5kW hybrid-gen3 inverter and 9.5kWh battery (daytime consumption probably down at the 6kWh level).

In general, I prefer to use timers on the inverter, rather than having to send "do this now", which relies on network. For dynamic behaviour, prefer to set a timer, so that it's "do this soon", which will give some tolerance for network delays.

Tariff is IOG. I've just had the Zappi rewired so that the inverter does not see it, so I no longer have to worry about the battery discharging if I got any random bonus charging slots. (Previously I asked for car to be ready by 7am (alarm clock time), as a compromise between constraining Octopus to finish charge too early, and extra slots interfering with planning. Max discharge rate was 250W between 0530 and 0700 so that if the car did charge after 0530, it took minimum power from the battery.)

I don't start the battery charge until after midnight, and therefore pause discharge from 2330 until start of charging. This is mainly for accounting purposes - it's convenient for all the charging to happen within one day, rather than having it happen at the end of one day for use the next day. But also, it seems rebalancing happens at low voltages if the battery is left idle, so it's now getting an hour to idle before charging.

When forcing charge/discharge, I try to do it at lower power for longer, when possible, in the belief that this is better for battery health. (Would be nice if you could store a power with each discharge slot, rather than having to keep swapping between max (when in dynamic mode) and around 1.5kW when doing a forced discharge.

Because export is a generous 15p, I inhibit charging battery from solar during the day, just exporting everything. However, since clipping is a potential issue at peak generation, I want to be able to divert some power to the battery around noon. Currently working on some givenergy_modbus monitoring to do that.

Tend to cook main meal around 1830, and from 2000 we don't use very much, so start dumping excess to grid. I might also add an extra rule to dump between 4pm and 5pm if there's a lot of charge in the battery at 4pm. More useful to the grid at this time, though don't want to impact savings sessions rewards (makes it a bit of a negative consequence of savings sessions).

### Bugs to workaround

To cope with clipping, using priority of grid should have been the mode I want, but that doesn't seem to work at all. So I'm using the timed pause feature to inhibit solar charging. I want to unpause the pause around noon, with max charging power of around 1kW. Pause timer is statically configured to run from 0700 to 2000. The pause mode is toggled between pause-charging and not-paused.

A bit of an anomaly in the AC charging limit: there are (at least) two different settings available via the API: #77 and #101. Unfortunately, #101 seems to be the one that the inverter actually uses, but #77 is the one the app sets. Because it's quite convenient to set via the app, my scripts copy from #77 to #101 in the evening.


The accumulating meter data for battery in/out seem broken, and daily meter resets at midnight, which is one of the reasons for not starting the batterty charge until after midnight.

To idle the battery between 2330 and 0030 (when car might be charging), I abuse the discharge timers slightly: by arranging a timed discharge, but setting a min SoC of 100%, it actually results in a timed pause. Unfortunately, there appears to be a bug in that if the time window crosses midnight, it doesn't honour the discharge limit. So I have to use two discharge slots. But that's fine - there are ten available. It seems to take at least a minute at the end of a timed discharge to return to normal behaviour, so that avoids having a gap. AC charge seems to take precendence over DC discharge, so I can overlap the timers.

### Summary

So to summarise:
* 0030 to 0529 - charging from grid, charging power calculated
* 0530 to 0700 - dynamic mode, full discharge power, charge power set to 0W
* 0700 to 1130 - battery-charging paused
* 1130 to 1200 - battery charging allowed up to 500W
* 1200 to 1430 - battery-charging allowed up to 1000W
* 1430 to 1530 - battery charging allowed up to 500W
* 1530 to 2000 - battery charging paused, dynamic mode, max discharge power
* 2000 to 2230 - scheduled discharge, power calculated to end with 8%
* 2230 to 2330 - dynamic
* 2330 to 0035 - discharge paused (via discharge slot #2/3 with min SoC 100%)

#### Static configuration
* charge timer 1 0030 to 0529 - variable charge power depending on what is required to reach target SoC
* discharge timer 1 typically runs from 2000 to 2230 - again, variable power aiming for 10% by 2230
* discharge timer 2 bodged to inhibit discharge between 2330 and 2359 (prevent discharge to car)
* discharge timer 3 bodged to inhibit discharge between 0000 and 0035 (prevent discharge to car)
* pause timer 0700 to 2000 (with pause mode adjusted dynamically)
* discharge mode set to scheduled - home demand. (ie eco + dc discharge enabled)

#### Dynamic stuff implemented by these scripts, via cron
* adjust pause mode as required  (plan to move this to use modbus soon)
* around 2330, calculate charging power required, and reduce discharge power
* around 0700, restore discharge power to max, and charge power to 0
* around 2000, decide whether to dump to grid, and adjust discharge power and/or ending time.

# Configuration
The scripts expect to find a config file in `~/.solar`  - this is in a format for configparser.
There needs to be a `[givenergy]` section with
 - `inverter` setting (identify the inverter) and a
 - `api_token` setting, which is an api token granting full inverter control.

For the pvoutput script, you need a `[pvoutput]` with
 - `name` name of your system
 - `Ã¬d` numerical id
 - `key` access key

# Scripts
The scripts are in bin/

## givenergy.py
They share a utility file `givenergy.py` which implements the API via the `requests` package. It auto-retries on failure.
Has some configuration at the top of the file giving settings numbers, which may need to be adjusted to match your inverter.

When invoked as a script with no parameters, it retrieves and prints the presets and settings available for your inverter.
Parameters can also be given: these can either be the numbers or short names of settings to retrieve and display, or in the form setting=value, will modify a setting. Available names are 'cp' and 'dp' for charge/discharge power, 'ps' and 'pe' for pause start and ends.

## givenergy-offpeak.py
`givenergy-offpeak.py` runs from cron just before the off-peak period and sets charge rate to reach the (already set) target % SoC  over 5 hours.

## givenergy-discharge.py
`givenergy-discharge.py` runs from cron at 8pm (after we've cooked main meal). If there's lots of juice left in the battery, it sets up to dump some to the grid.

## pvoutput.py
`pvoutput.py` runs once per day, via cron. It downloads the day's parameters, and uploads to pvoutput.



# monitor.py

This is the modbus script I use for clipping-avoidance. Very much still work in progress (partly because modbus itself is still work in progress).
It probably uses the latest 'dev' branch at https://github.com/divenal/givenergy-modbus-async
